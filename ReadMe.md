# Starbucks data study

In this project, I will study the behaviors of Starbucks coffee customers and how they change during offer periods and study these customers' minds and how they respond to delicious offers. The store poses it, and I will try to record useful results with two questions:

 - How far is the revenue in the period of the shows?
 - Who are the customers who are interested in these offers?
 - The results appeared as follows:

## In terms of age groups:

## Changes in revenue:

 We can deduce from the above statistics that the change in prices clearly changes the behavior of the customers
 In all target groups, the same rule applies to revenues
